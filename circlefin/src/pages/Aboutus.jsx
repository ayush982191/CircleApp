    //           Barak Fund Management, launched in 2008, has built up a track record of 11 years in African alternative credit
    //           financing and to date has provided funding of over US$5bn to a variety of SME businesses in more than 30 countries
    //           across the continent. Barak has African origination and fund advisory offices in Mauritius, South Africa, Kenya,
    //           Ghana, Ivory Coast and the UK, and has 25 on-the-ground investment specialists focusing on a variety of
    //           commodity sectors. It provides a variety of funding structures including both Impact, Development and Shariah-compliant funding.

    //           Barak manages 7 credit funds focusing on SME commodity trade finance and infrastructure development with a total AUM in excess of US$1.4bn to date.
    //           Barak provides fund management solutions to a range of global investors and funding to an extensive list of counterparties throughout Africa,
    //           working with direct producers and farmers, as well as traders offering a broad network across the continent.
    //           <div className='ml-20'>
    //             Barak’s core investment rationale is related primarily to the soft agricultural and food-related sectors,
    //             though the flagship STF Fund does also finance the mining, energy and other commodity-related sectors.

    //             The Barak investment approach is based upon the principles of discipline, diversification, collateralization and downside-case scenario valuation.
    //             The company acknowledges that African investments encompass a certain degree of risk given the nature of investing in a continent whose primary markets are influenced by a multitude of volatile factors. Each investment is thus approached with a stringent on-boarding process – using both desktop and on-the-ground due-diligence processes in order to determine the viability of a potential project’s funding.
